/* code explanation
//Initially the thread is in the new state.After calling start(),it moves to RUNNABLE and executes the run() method.
//The exact timing of the state changes depends on the JVM Scheduler
//Points to remember
//thread is created once
//start() changes state
//thread cannot be restarted
//final state is terminated or deac
